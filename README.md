The rapid advancement in AI and machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), has opened up new avenues for interacting with databases. Traditionally, database interaction requires users to be proficient in Structured Query Language (SQL). However, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), there is now potential for users to interact with databases through natural language, making database queries more intuitive and accessible. This project aims to build a question-and-answer system that can interact with a MySQL database using natural language.
 
Natural Language Database Interaction using LLM 

• Developed a Natural Language Database Interaction system tailored for a t-shirt selling store using cutting-edge technologies such as LangChain, LLM, and Hugging Face.

• Fine-tuned the model with few-shot learning to create an efficient question-and-answer system capable of interacting seamlessly with a MySQL database to generate SQL query and ensuring precise data retrieval.

• Added a simple and intuitive user interface with Streamlit for easy interaction.
